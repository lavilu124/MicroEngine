## expactaions
currrently this is more of an extanion to sfml rather then a game engine
i am a busy 16 years old who programs this in his free time so i do not have a lot of time to work on this so it might be a bit rough around the edges but this is mostly practices for myself.
there are stuff that i started developing that are not finished (namespaces that aren't in all places....)
sadly my last repo was giving me problems so i moved to a new one meaing all not finished stuff are in the main branch
(this engine is still being build and is not a perfect or a complete product)
(currently dosent have any ui of game engine just a core)
